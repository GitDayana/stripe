  <p>
    We’re starting to add support for displaying <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fcheckout">Checkout</a> in your customers’ preferred languages. In addition to English, Checkout now speaks Japanese, German, French, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch.
  </p>

  <img src='../../img/blog/posts/checkout-localization/checkout-localization.png' width='332' height='487' data-hires='true' id='checkout-l10n' />

  <p>
    We tested this feature with over 220,000 customers across different types of businesses and found that displaying a translated Checkout converts significantly better for many companies—in particular, where the rest of their website is translated. For those sites, revenue from non-English speakers increased by between <strong>7 and 12 percent</strong>—a huge jump for one tiny checkout change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on our results, we strongly recommend you enable this feature if you already have a website in the eight languages we currently support.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can opt in to using the translated version with a single line of code. If you’re using the simple integration, just pass <code><span class="kwd">data-locale</span>=<span class="string">"auto"</span></code> into the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. If you have a custom integration, use <code><span class="kwd">locale</span>: <span class="string">'auto'</span></code> when calling <code>StripeCheckout.configure()</code>. There’s more info in the <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fcheckout">docs</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This change illustrates part of our broader goal with Checkout: to deliver a constant stream of refinements that automatically improve your checkout flow and help you reach more customers.

    <p>Starting today, you can add <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Famex-express-checkout">Amex Express Checkout</a> to your site or app with a single code snippet.

<p>American Express has partnered with Stripe to let over 20 million cardholders pay online and in apps using their existing American Express login, rather than entering their full credit card details.

<p>When you integrate, American Express will also securely pass on useful customer information to you such as address, email, and phone number. They'll even automatically keep that info up to date. (You’ll get a <code>customer.updated</code> webhook.) You’ll have the latest information for your customers without having to prompt them to manually update their data on your site.

<p>During our beta, we worked to make accepting Amex Express Checkout as straightforward as possible. To include the button, just configure the <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Famex-express-checkout">helper library</a> with a <code>client_id</code> that you can <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/amex_express_checkout/enable">generate</a> in the Dashboard:

<pre><code>&lt;amex:init <span class="token kwd">client_id</span>=<span class="token string">"30e73189-96f4-4797-83d4-6730bf6bed19"</span>
  <span class="token kwd">env</span>=<span class="token string">"production"</span> <span class="token kwd">callback</span>=<span class="token string">"aecCallbackHandler"</span> /&gt;
&lt;script <span class="token kwd">src</span>=<span class="token string">"https://icm.aexp-static.com/Internet/IMDC/US_en/
  RegisteredCard/AmexExpressCheckout/js/
  AmexExpressCheckout.js"</span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As with other payment types, you’ll get a <code>card</code> token that you can use to create charges. You’ll also see these payments alongside other payment types in the Dashboard or via the API.

<p>If you’re interested, check out the <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Famex-express-checkout">guide to getting started</a>. If you’ve got any questions or feedback, <a href="mailto:christian.anderson@stripe.com">please let me know</a>!

<p>
  At Stripe, we make extensive use of automated testing to help ensure
  the stability and reliability of our services. We have expansive
  test coverage for our API and other core services, we run tests on a
  continuous integration server over every git branch, and we never deploy without green
  tests.
</p>

<p>
  The size and complexity of our codebase has grown over the past few years—and
  so has the size of the test suite. As of August 2015, we have over 1400 test
  files that define nearly 15,000 test cases and make over 130,000 assertions.
  According to our CI server, the tests would take over three hours if run
  sequentially.
</p>

<p>
  With a large (and growing) group of engineers waiting for those tests
  with every change they make, the speed of running tests is
  critical. We’ve used a number of hosted CI solutions in the past,
  but as test runtimes crept past 10 minutes, we brought
  testing in-house to give us more control and room for experimentation.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, we’ve implemented our own distributed test runner that
  brought the runtime of our tests to just under three minutes.  While
  some of these tactics are specific to our codebase and systems, we
  hope sharing what we did to improve our test runtimes will help
  other engineering organizations.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Forking executor</h3>
<p>
  We write tests
  using <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest" class="github">minitest</a>,
  but we've implemented our
  own <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest#writing-extensions">plugin</a>
  to execute tests in parallel across multiple CPUs on multiple
  different servers.
</p>

<p>
  In order to get maximum parallel performance out of our build
  servers, we run tests in separate processes, allowing each process to make
  maximum use of the machine's CPU and I/O capability. (We run builds on
  Amazon's <code>c4.8xlarge</code> instances, which give us 36 cores each.)
</p>

<p>
  Initially, we experimented with using Ruby's threads instead
  of multiple processes, but discovered that using a large number of
  threads was significantly slower than using multiple processes. This
  slowdown was present even if the ruby threads were doing nothing but
  monitoring subprocess children. Our current runner doesn’t use Ruby threads at all.
</p>

<p>
  When tests start up, we start by loading all of our application code into
  a single Ruby process so we don’t have to parse and load all
  our Ruby code and gem dependencies multiple times.
  This process then calls <code>fork</code> a
  number of times to produce N different processes that’ll each have
  all of the code pre-loaded and ready to go.
</p>

<p>
  Each of those workers then starts executing tests. As they execute
  tests, our custom executor <code>fork</code>s further: Each
  process <code>fork</code>s and executes a single test file’s worth
  of tests inside the child process. The child process writes the
  results to the parent over a pipe, and then exits.
</p>

<p>
  This second round of <code>fork</code>ing provides a layer of isolation
  between tests: If a test makes changes to global state, running the test
  inside a throwaway process will clean everything up once that process
  exits. Isolating state at a per-file level also means that running
  individual tests on developer machines will behave similarly to the
  way they behave in CI, which is an important debugging affordance.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Docker</h2>

<p>
  The custom forking executor spawns a lot of processes, and creates a
  number of scratch files on disk. We run all builds at Stripe inside
  of Docker, which means we don't need to worry about cleaning up all
  of these processes or this on-disk state. At the end of a build,
  all of the state—be that in-memory processes or on
  disk—will be cleaned up by a <code>docker stop</code>, every
  time.
</p>

<p>
  Managing trees of UNIX processes is notoriously difficult to do
  reliably, and it would be easy for a system that <code>fork</code>s
  this often to leak zombie processes or stray workers (especially
  during development of the test framework itself). Using a
  containerization solution like Docker eliminates that
  nuisance, and eliminates the need to write a bunch of fiddly cleanup
  code.
</p>

<hr />
<h2>Managing build workers</h2>

<p>
  In order to run each build across multiple machines at once, we
  need a system to keep track of which servers are currently in-use
  and which ones are free, and to assign incoming work to available
  servers.
</p>

<p>
  We run all our tests inside
  of <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>; Rather than
  writing custom code to manage worker pools, we (ab)use a Jenkins
  plugin called
  the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Matrix+Project+Plugin">matrix
  build plugin</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The matrix build plugin is designed for projects where you want a
  "build matrix" that tests a project in multiple environments. For
  example, you might want to build every release of a library against
  several versions of Ruby and make sure it works on each of them.
</p>

<p>
  We misuse it slightly by configuring a custom build axis, called
  <code>BUILD_ROLE</code>, and telling Jenkins to build with
  <code>BUILD_ROLE=leader</code>, <code>BUILD_ROLE=worker1</code>,
  <code>BUILD_ROLE=worker2</code>, and so on. This causes Jenkins to
  run N simultaneous jobs for each build.
</p>

<p>
  Combined with
  some <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Heavy+Job+Plugin">other
  Jenkins configuration</a>, we can ensure that each of these builds
  runs on its own machine. Using this, we can take
  advantage of Jenkins worker management, scheduling, and resource
  allocation to accomplish our goal of maintaining a large pool of
  identical workers and allocating a small number of them for each
  build.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>NSQ</h2>

<p>
  Once we have a pool of workers running, we decide which tests to run
  on each node.
</p>

<p>
  One tactic for splitting work—used by several of our previous test
  runners—is to split tests up statically. You decide ahead of time
  which workers will run which tests, and then each worker just runs
  those tests start-to-finish. A simple version of this strategy just
  hashes each test and take the result modulo the number of workers;
  Sophisticated versions can record how long each test took, and try
  to divide tests into group of equal total runtime.
</p>

<p>
  The problem with static allocations is that they’re extremely prone
  to stragglers. If you guess wrong about how long tests will take, or
  if one server is briefly slow for whatever reason, it’s very easy
  for one job to finish far after all the others, which means slower,
  less efficient, tests.
</p>

<p>
  We opted for an alternate, dynamic approach, which allocates work in
  real-time using a work queue. We manage all coordination between
  workers using an <a href="http://nsq.io/">nsqd</a>
  instance. <code>nsq</code> is a super-simple queue that was
  developed at <a href="http://bit.ly">Bit.ly</a>; we already use it
  in a few other places, so it was natural to adopt here.
</p>

<p>
  Using the build number provided by Jenkins, we separate distinct
  test runs. Each run makes use of three queues to coordinate work:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The node with <code>BUILD_ROLE=leader</code> writes each test
      file that needs to be run into
      the <code>test.&lt;BUILD_NUMBER&gt;.jobs</code> queue.
    </li>
    <li>
      As workers execute tests, they write the results back to the
      <code>test.&lt;BUILD_NUMBER&gt;.results</code> queue, where they
      are collected by the leader node.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the leader has results for each test, it writes "kill"
      signals to the <code>test.&lt;BUILD_NUMBER&gt;.shutdown</code>
      queue, one for each worker machine. A thread on each worker
      pulls off a single event and terminates all work on that node.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Each worker machine forks off a pool of
  processes after loading code. Each of those processes independently
  reads from the <code>jobs</code> queue and executes tests. By
  relying on nsq for coordination even within a single machine, we
  have no need for a second, machine-local, communication mechanism,
  which might risk limiting our concurrency across multiple CPUs.
</p>

<p>
  Other than the <code>leader</code> node, all nodes are homogenous;
  they blindly pull work off the queue and execute it, and otherwise
  behave identically.
</p>

<p>
  Dynamic allocation has proven to be hugely effective. All of our
  worker processes across all of our different machines reliably
  finish within a few seconds of each other, which means we're making
  excellent use of our available resources.
</p>

<p>
  Because workers only accept jobs as they go, work remains
  well-balanced even if things go slightly awry: Even if one of the
  servers starts up slightly slowly, or if there isn't enough capacity
  to start all four servers right at once, or if the servers happen to
  be on different-sized hardware, we still tend to see every worker
  finishing essentially at once.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Visualization</h2>

<p>
  Reasoning about and understanding performance of a distributed
  system is always a challenging task. If tests aren't finishing
  quickly, it's important that we can understand why so we can debug
  and resolve the issue.
</p>

<p>
  The right visualization can often capture performance characteristics
  and problems in a very powerful (and visible) way, letting operators
  spot the problems immediately, without having to pore through reams of
  log files and timing data.
</p>

<p>
  To this end, we've built a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_chart">waterfall
  visualizer</a> for our test runner. The test processes record timing
  data as they run, and save the result in a central file on the build
  leader. Some Javascript <code>d3</code> code can then assemble that
  data into a waterfall diagram showing when each individual job started
  and stopped.
</p>

<div class="image-center waterfall">
  <img src="../../img/blog/posts/distributed-ruby-testing/jenkins-slow-run.png" data-hires="true" width="275">
  <img src="../../img/blog/posts/distributed-ruby-testing/jenkins-fast-run.png" data-hires="true" width="275">
  <p>Waterfall diagrams of a slow test run and a fast test run.</p>
</div>

<p>
  Each group of blue bars shows tests run by a single process on a
  single machine. The black lines that drop down near the right show
  the finish times for each process. In the first visualization, you
  can see that the first process (and to a lesser extent, the second)
  took much longer to finish than all the others, meaning a single
  test was holding up the entire build.
</p>

<p>
  By default, our test runner uses test files as the unit of
  parallelism, with each process running an entire file at a
  time. Because of stragglers like the above case, we implemented an
  option to split individual test files further, distributing the
  individual test classes in the file instead of the entire file.
</p>

<p>
  If we apply that option to the slow files and re-run, all the "finished"
  lines collapse into one, indicating that every process on every worker
  finished at essentially the same time—an optimal usage of resources.
</p>

<p>
  Notice also that the waterfall graphs show processes generally going
  from slower tests to faster ones. The test runner keeps a persistent
  cache recording how long each test took on previous runs, and
  enqueues tests starting with the slowest. This ensures that slow
  tests start as soon as possible and is important for ensuring an
  optimal work distribution.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  The decision to invest effort in our own testing infrastructure
  wasn't necessarily obvious: we could have continued to use a
  third-party solution. However, spending a comparatively small amount
  of effort allowed the rest of our engineering organization to move
  significantly faster—and with more confidence. I'm also optimistic
  this test runner will continue to scale with us and support our
  growth for several years to come.
</p>

<p>
  If you end up implementing something like this (or have
  already), <a href="mailto:nelhage@stripe.com">send me a note</a>!
  I'd love to hear what you've done, and what's worked or hasn't for
  others with similar problems.

<p>We’ve been in beta in the Nordics for the past year. In that time, we’ve had the chance to work closely with a growing number of companies here to better understand the challenges they face to run a business in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.</p>

<p>Starting today, any company in these countries can set up a Stripe account and accept live charges in minutes. As usual, all businesses can accept payments from customers around the world in <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/which-currencies-does-stripe-support">over 135 currencies</a>.</p>

<p>Based on our conversations with many of our beta users, we’re also updating our <a href="../../pricing">pricing</a> for the countries in the region:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Denmark:</strong> 1.7% + 1.8kr for Danish cards and 2.9% + 1.8kr for international cards</li>
  <li><strong>Finland:</strong> 2.0% + 20c for Finnish cards and 2.9% + 20c for international cards</li>
  <li><strong>Norway:</strong> 2.4% + 2kr for Norwegian cards and 2.9% + 2kr for international cards</li>
  <li><strong>Sweden:</strong> 1.9% + 1.8kr for Swedish cards and 2.9% + 1.8kr for international cards</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to the hundreds of beta users who’ve helped to shape our product for the Nordics. We’ve been delighted to work with a wide variety of companies to bring their businesses online—from <a href="https://www.cancerfonden.se/">Cancerfonden</a> (Sweden’s largest non-profit organization for cancer research) to <a href="https://tictail.com/">Tictail</a> (a platform that lets users create and run beautiful online stores within minutes).</p>

<p>Now that we’re fully launched, we’re looking forward to seeing all the new experiences you’ll build with Stripe.</p>

  Upgrades! We love them. You know you’re doing something right when a user wants to pay more for your product. But upgrades can be tricky, too. If you <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fsubscriptions%252Fguide#upgrading-or-downgrading-plans">prorate</a> the change, your customers may be confused on how much they’ll be charged on their next bill.
</p>

<p>
  We now offer a preview of upgrade charges for subscriptions before they happen. You can see how switching plans or changing quantities would impact a customer by querying the <code><a href="../../docs/api/index.html#upcoming_invoice">upcoming invoices</a></code> endpoint. We’ll return an estimate of the user’s next invoice, including any applicable prorations. You can display this estimate to users to maximize the chance they finish their upgrade.
</p>

<p>
  Here’s an example of what happens when you send a new subscription plan your customer is considering:
</p>

<pre><code>
curl -G <span class="token string">https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices/upcoming</span> \
   -u <span class="token string">sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2</span>: \
   -d <span class="token keyword">customer</span>=<span class="token string">cus_66Nqfe223Fjuy0</span> \
   -d <span class="token keyword">subscription</span>=<span class="token string">sub_66Nux8KYRsiquq</span> \
   -d <span class="token keyword">subscription_plan</span>=<span class="token string">super_gold_plan</span>

{
  <span class="kwd">"date"</span>: <span class="int">1432252223</span>,
  <span class="kwd">"period_start"</span>: <span class="int">1429808152</span>,
  <span class="kwd">"period_end"</span>: <span class="int">1432252223</span>,
  <span class="kwd">"next_payment_attempt"</span>: <span class="int">1432255823</span>,
  <span class="meta">...</span>
  <span class="kwd">"amount_due"</span>: <span class="int">1762</span>
}</code></pre>

<p>
  You can also estimate the charge for a subscription change at a specific point of time in the future. Just pass a <code>proration_date</code> when previewing the amount.
</p>

<p>
  We hope this helps provide your customers with more predictable upgrades (or downgrades). If you have any questions or feedback, please <a href="mailto:peter.raboud@stripe.com">let me know</a>.

<p>In 2012, we noticed that many of the most exciting Stripe users were building businesses that helped others accept money. <a href="https://shopify.com">Shopify</a> was helping e-commerce businesses get started and <a href="https://postmates.com">Postmates</a> was building a mobile restaurant delivery network. In October 2012, we <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fblog%252Fstripe-connect">launched</a> Stripe Connect to allow these multi-sided platforms to connect with thousands of seller accounts on Stripe.</p>

<p>Plenty has changed since then. The number of these platforms has exploded: services like Instacart, Kickstarter, Shyp, Tilt, Lyft, TaskRabbit, and Handy. Stripe has helped over half a million sellers get paid on platforms like these. And we’ve learned a lot about the subtleties of each use case.</p>

<p>Regular businesses just need to accept money from buyers, but running one of these platforms is much more complex. They also have to verify seller identity (to comply with know-your-customer laws and to prevent fraud), collect and verify their sellers’ banking information, track seller earnings, help sellers get paid on the right schedule, handle IRS tax reporting requirements, and more. I get tired just thinking about it.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../marketplaces">new Stripe Connect</a> is the result of everything we’ve learned from powering these platforms. The changes we’ve made make setting up accounts for sellers even easier—they don’t need to even come to Stripe. You can now support sellers in more countries. And Stripe helps with everything involved in operating the platform.</p>

<h2>Managed accounts</h2>
<p>In addition to connecting to regular Stripe accounts (which Connect has supported since 2012), we’re now enabling platforms to spin up and administer “managed accounts”. Managed accounts allow you to customize all aspects of the experience for sellers—from what the setup flow looks like and payment schedules to who pays fees and when info is collected. These managed accounts can be set up for sellers wherever Stripe is supported (<a href="../../pt">18 countries</a>, with more coming this year). This unifies our previously-separate “<a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fblog%252Fsend-payouts-with-stripe">Transfers API</a>” with Connect.</p>

<div class="feature-list">
  <h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong> Lightweight setup for sellers</h3>
  <p>With <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fconnect%252Fmanaged-accounts">managed accounts</a>, Stripe gets out of the way of your relationship with your sellers or contractors. You can fully customize how sellers join your platform and build very lightweight sign up flows. In fact, you can get a seller started with just a country and email address using the new <code><a href="../../docs/api/index.html#account">accounts</a></code> endpoint:</p>

<pre><code>curl <span class="token string">https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts</span> \
   -u <span class="token string">sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2</span>: \
   -d <span class="token keyword">managed</span>=<span class="token boolean">true</span> \
   -d <span class="token keyword">country</span>=<span class="token string">US</span> \
   -d <span class="token keyword">email</span>=<span class="token string">fleet.driver@example.com</span>

{
  <span class="meta">...</span>
  <span class="kwd">"id"</span>: <span class="string">"acct_12QkqYGSOD4VcegJ"</span>,
  <span class="kwd">"keys"</span>: {
    <span class="kwd">"secret"</span>: <span class="string">"sk_live_AxSI9q6ieYWjGIeRbURf6EG0"</span>,
    <span class="kwd">"publishable"</span>: <span class="string">"pk_live_h9xguYGf2GcfytemKs5tHrtg"</span>,
  },
  <span class="kwd">"managed"</span>: <span class="boolean">true</span>,
  <span class="meta">...</span>
}</code></pre>

  <p>We’ll send back the seller’s account information, which you can use to <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fconnect%252Fpayments-fees">start creating charges</a> on their behalf right away. We’ll let you know via the <code>account.updated</code> webhook if and when you need to collect any additional info about your sellers.</p>

  <p>When creating charges, you can also specify the seller receiving the funds. Stripe will handle paying out the seller on the schedule you specified, and you won’t need to manually reconcile payments and transfers, making accounting and bookkeeping easier:</p>

<pre><code>curl <span class="token string">https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges</span> \
   -u <span class="token string">sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2</span>: \
   -d <span class="token keyword">amount</span>=<span class="token int">1000</span> \
   -d <span class="token keyword">currency</span>=<span class="token string">EUR</span> \
   -d <span class="token keyword">customer</span>=<span class="token string">cus_49mpFwI9tFb1AO</span> \
   -d <span class="token keyword">destination</span>=<span class="token string">acct_12QkqYGSOD4VcegJ</span>
   -d <span class="token keyword">application_fee</span>=<span class="token int">200</span></code>
</pre>

  <h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong> International sellers</h3>
  <p>Scaling businesses internationally can be pretty hard, but it’s especially difficult for platforms. Traditionally, supporting sellers in other countries required you to either run all international transactions through the U.S. (which meant more declined cards and currency conversion fees) or registering local business entities in every region supported.</p>

  <p>With Connect, we’ve worked to help you provide a local experience for your sellers while keeping your code manageable and scalable. For example, you might need a Spanish crowdfunding campaign’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT_identification_number#European_Union_VAT_identification_numbers">Número de Identificación Fiscal</a> or an Australian boutique’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Business_Number">ABN</a> before they can get paid. In all these cases, we’ll help you out and let you know what info to collect via the aptly-named <code>fields_needed</code> array on the account.</p>

  <h3><strong class="update"><span>Update</span></strong> Build apps for Stripe users</h3>
  <p>As before, you can use Connect to get secure access to Stripe data, and use that to build dashboards, invoicing integrations, feature add-ons, and more. If you like being meta, you can now also create <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fintegrations">integrations</a> specifically for platforms, such as the one built by <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/self-employed/">QuickBooks</a> for self-employed workers.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Pricing</h2>
  <p>Nearly all of Connect’s functionality is free. The cost for accepting payments remains the <a href="../../pricing">same</a>. Setting up managed accounts costs just 0.5% of funds paid out—this flat rate includes ID verification, helping to generate tax documents where necessary, and even international accounts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’re thrilled to see diverse marketplaces and platforms being built and grown on Stripe.</p>

<p>Marketplaces have always been a big deal (just ask <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/11/13/all-markets-are-not-created-equal-10-factors-to-consider-when-evaluating-digital-marketplaces/">Bill Gurley</a>), but we think that they’re likely to become more important still. As the rise of smartphones lets internet businesses make the leap from the virtual to the real world, we think that enormously successful marketplaces and platforms remain to be built. We look forward to building the most useful tools and APIs for them along the way.</p>

<p>Thanks very much to our beta users for their feedback which has helped us shape the product. If you have any questions, <a href="mailto:brian.krausz@stripe.com">get in touch</a>!</p>

      <span>on</span> March 11, 2015
    </p>
  </header>
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>
  As we expand the range of payment types that we support, we’ve released a <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fupgrades#2015-02-18">new API version</a> to unify the interface across payments of all types.
</p>

<p>
  Globally, credit cards are the source of most online payments but they’re far from ubiquitous. Local payment mechanisms (such as <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Falipay">China’s prominent e-wallets</a>) power commerce in markets around the world. Meanwhile, novel payment types, from <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fbitcoin">digital currencies</a> to <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fapple-pay">Apple Pay</a>, are establishing new standards for online transactions.
</p>

<p>
  In accepting these new instruments, there’s a lot to be excited about: broader global reach, increased revenue, and improved user experience. We want to make supporting them as easy as possible—hence building this unified API. For essentially all purposes, a payment is a payment regardless of where it came from. Payments of all types behave identically in the API and <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com">Dashboard</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Here’s a quick overview of the new API version:
</p>

<div class="feature-list">
  <h3><strong class="update"><span>Update</span></strong>Create a charge from a source</h3>

  <p>
  <a href="../../docs/api/index.html#charge_object">Charge objects</a> returned by the API now have a <code>source</code> property in place of the <code>card</code> property. This describes the source that you used for the charge, such as a <a href="../../docs/api/index.html#card_object">card</a> or <a href="../../docs/api/index.html#bitcoin_receiver_object">Bitcoin receiver</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can still create a charge using the <code>card</code> parameter, but it is now superseded by the <code>source</code> parameter.
  </p>

  <h3><strong class="update"><span>Update</span></strong>Manage customer sources</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="../../docs/api/index.html#customer_object">Customer objects</a> now have the <code>sources</code> and <code>default_source</code> properties in place of <code>cards</code> and <code>default_card</code>. Similarly, we’ve introduced the new request parameters <code>source</code> and <code>default_source</code> although the old parameters will be supported indefinitely.

  <p>
    There is a new API endpoint for managing the customer’s payment sources beyond just cards: <code>/v1/customers/{CUSTOMER_ID}/sources</code>.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Here is an example of creating a charge in the new API version:</p>

<pre><code>
curl <span class="token string">https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges</span> \
   -u <span class="token string">sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2</span>: \
   -d <span class="token keyword">source</span>=<span class="token string">aliacc_4hzzUhIjJ9sZZv</span> \
   -d <span class="token keyword">amount</span>=<span class="token string">1000</span> \
   -d <span class="token keyword">currency</span>=<span class="token string">usd</span>

{
  <span class="kwd">"id"</span>: <span class="string">"ch_15aZNk2eZvKYlo2CW82HVvQf"</span>,
  <span class="kwd">"object"</span>: <span class="string">"charge"</span>,
  <span class="kwd">"amount"</span>: <span class="int">1000</span>,
  <span class="kwd">"currency"</span>: <span class="string">"usd"</span>,
  <span class="kwd">"source"</span>: {
    <span class="kwd">"id"</span>: <span class="string">"aliacc_4hzzUhIjJ9sZZv"</span>,
    <span class="kwd">"object"</span>: <span class="string">"alipay_account"</span>,
    <span class="kwd">"created"</span>: <span class="int">1424987420</span>,
    <span class="kwd">"username"</span>: <span class="string">"maidongxi@example.com"</span>,
    <span class="kwd">"reusable"</span>: <span class="boolean">true</span>,
    <span class="meta">...</span>
  },
  <span class="meta">...</span>
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Switching to the <code>source</code> property means that you don’t need additional code changes to accept the new payment types that we add over time. We’ve made this switch as easy as possible: old API versions include both the old and new properties on all responses. For instance, if you charge a card on an old API version then the charge object will have identical <code>card</code> and <code>source</code> properties. If you charge an Alipay account on an old API version then the <code>card</code> property will be null and the <code>source</code> property will be the Alipay account.
</p>

<p>
  If you have questions or feedback about this change, then we’d love to <a href="mailto:max.lahey@stripe.com">hear from you</a>!
