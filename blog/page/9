<p> Stripe is now in beta in the UK, and to celebrate we're throwing a hackathon in London. Come hack on a project, meet other coders, hang out, or just work on eating the food. Feel free to bring your own project or start one on the fly. </p>

<p> This hackathon will be very informal. Stripe (in conjunction with <a href="http://level39.co/">Level 39</a>) provides the space and the food. You provide the project, or start one with other coders who are attending. Your goal for the day should be to walk away having built something cool. Past Stripe hackathon projects have ranged from building a simple PHP website to adding a new feature to Git to assembling a 3-D printer. </p>

<p> All are welcome (no ghostly hounds allowed, though)! </p>

<p>Stripe makes it easy to accept payments on any platform: web, mobile, desktop, or tablet. Many companies, like <a href="http://www.lyft.me/">Lyft</a>, <a href="https://iamexec.com/">Exec</a>, <a href="http://www.postmates.com/">Postmates</a>, <a href="http://www.side.cr/">SideCar</a>, <a href="http://sincerely.com/sesame">Sesame</a>, and <a href="https://www.orderaheadapp.com/">OrderAhead</a>, use Stripe to make paying on your iPhone or Android a snap.</p>

  <div class="feature-list">

  <h3><strong class="update"><span>Update</span></strong> Updated Android &amp; iOS libraries </h3>

  <p>We’re releasing updated versions of our <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fmobile%252Fios">iOS</a> and <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fmobile%252Fandroid">Android</a> libraries today. They use the same <a href="../../docs/api/index.html#tokens">tokenization</a> system that Stripe.js uses, ensuring that sensitive card data doesn't pass through your servers.</p>

  <h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong> Drop-in iOS card textfield</h3>
  <p>We've created a beautiful <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fmobile%252Fios">drop-in iOS UIView</a> that'll deal with all the card formatting, validation and form building for you.</p>
  </div>

<p>These libraries make it easy to accept payments in any iPhone, iPad, and Android application. Our <a href="../../docs/mobile/index.html">mobile guides</a> walk you through collecting credit card information, <a href="../../docs/api/index.html#tokens">tokenizing cards</a>, and storing payment credentials for billing later.</p>

<hr>

<p>Today, we’re also partnering with <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a>. Parse helps developers create mobile applications by eliminating a lot of the server-side boilerplate and providing pre-built libraries for common tasks.</p>

<p>If you're building an app on Parse and want to accept payments, you don't need to write any server-side code. Just create a Stripe token within your mobile app, and then pass the token to a Parse Cloud Code function to create a charge. There’s more in <a href="https://www.parse.com/docs/cloud_modules_guide#stripe">Parse’s documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Both the Parse platform and Stripe’s mobile libraries help with building native mobile apps, but the mobile web is growing rapidly too. We released <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Fcheckout">Checkout</a> a few weeks ago to help create better payment flows. (Head over to <a href="http://the-magazine.org/">The Magazine</a> and subscribe from your phone if you’d like to see it in action.) If you’re building for the web, Checkout delivers an optimized flow for all devices, including smartphone and tablet browsers.</p>

<p>We have many more improvements planned, and we’d love to hear your feedback on what we’ve built to date.</p>

  <p>We wanted to share some quick news of a few ways the Stripe dashboard has gotten even better:</p>

  <div class="feature-list">

    <h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong> Two-step Overview in Team Settings</h3>

    <p>A few months ago we added <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fblog%252Ftwo-step-verification">two-step verification</a> to Stripe. Now, you can see which members of your team have enabled this additional protection in your <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/team">team settings</a>.</p>

    <h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong> API Errors Overview</h3>
    <p>Though we hope it happens rarely, your API requests will sometimes return an error. If you’ve set up careful monitoring on your servers, you might get e-mailed about these errors. And if you’re vigilant, you might actually investigate them. We thought we could make this process a bit easier, and take some of the burden off your own monitoring in the process.</p>

    <p>Now, when you visit your dashboard <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs/overview">logs</a>, you'll be greeted with an overview that includes any recent errors returned by our API. You can review details about the cause of each error, and suggestions actions we think you may want to take as a result.</p>

    <h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong> Retry Test Webhooks</h3>
    <p>Integrating webhooks can get a bit complicated, given the wide range of scenarios you may want to test, and the natural process of working out the bugs in your webhook endpoints. To help, we've added a quick <em>retry</em> button on every event page.</p>

    <h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong> Friendlier Events List</h3>
    <p>We think our event system is great because it’s so powerful and flexible. And yet, when reviewing events on your dashboard, the interesting things that are happening your account can be a bit hard to see. So we’ve redesigned the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/events">event list</a> to make it easier to read and understand.</p>

    <div class="img no-border events"><img src="../../img/blog/posts/events-update/events.png" width="529" height="126" data-hires="true"></div>

    <p>Instead of just listing IDs and types, we show you a short sentence describing what happened in each event. It’s something like a news feed for everything happening in your account, with pictures of your customers right next to each story (based on their email addresses, and powered by <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>).</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p> <b> UPDATE: in December 2014 (about a year and half after this post), we blogged about our experiences <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fblog%252Fscaling-email-transparency">scaling email transparency</a>. </b> </p>

<p>A few months ago, <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fabout#alexmaccaw">Alex</a> blogged about <a href="http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/stripes-culture">how we work at Stripe</a>. In the post, he described how almost all of Stripe’s email is public inside the company. Since then, many people have asked about how this email openness actually works. Is it really the case all our mail is copied to a list? If so, how do we avoid drowning in email?</p>

<p>This post is an attempt to describe a little more about why we do this and how we stay afloat.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Initially, the motivation for having all email be internally public and searchable was simply to make us more efficient. If everyone automatically knew what was happening, we needed fewer meetings, and our coordination was more fluid and more painless if we could all keep up with the stream.</p>

<p>As we’ve grown, the experiment has become about both efficiency and philosophy. We don’t just want Stripe to be a successful product and company. We also want to try to optimize the experience of working here. As as we’ve grown, we’ve come to realize that open email can help.</p>

<p>We value autonomy, rigorous debate, and avoiding hierarchy to the extent that we can. Startups often pride themselves on having a flat management structure but are eventually forced to put a formal coordination infrastructure in place as the number of actors grows. So far, our experience has been that an ambiently open flow of information helps to provide people with the context they need to choose useful things to work on. It doesn’t eliminate the need for other kinds of structure, but it does make emergent coordination much easier and more likely.</p>

<p>It also makes it more likely that controversial issues are addressed as they arise, counteracting inevitable conflict-avoidance tendencies. The open flow obviates a lot of internal politics and avoids the sort of accidental surprises that sometimes crop up in organizations. It also makes everyone happier. Most people at Stripe are information junkies, and are naturally curious about how other parts of the organization work. We want to encourage that.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>While the principles might seem worthwhile, the obvious question is how it can actually work in practice. The amount of email we generate increases at least linearly with number of people. How do we avoid being overwhelmed?</p>

<p>Over the last two years, we’ve gradually added structure as necessary in order to keep things under control. What we have today works pretty well for our current size—around 45 people.</p>

<p>We use Gmail for email and Google Groups for lists. We’ve been able to scale our particular usage with a custom list management interface built on the Google Groups API. The interface makes it easy to manage list subscriptions, get notified of new lists being created, and so on. (We plan to open-source it at some point.)</p>

<p id="filters">Once people are subscribed to the right lists, dealing with the large volume of email efficiently is the next step. We use a number of filters to ensure that the traffic gets sensibly handled and categorized. The vast majority of our email is automatically labeled, archived, and then skimmed occasionally. The semantics can get pretty subtle, and <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fabout#andreas">Andreas</a> wrote a <a href="https://github.com/antifuchs/gmail-britta">filter manager</a> that many of us use. </p>

<h2>List structure</h2>

<p>We have 119 lists as I write this post. Most of the lists are specific to a particular project, but some (such as 311@, if you have an issue you’re otherwise not sure where to send, or shipped@, where you announce something you’ve launched or completed) are company-wide. </p>

<p>In order to make this work, strong and clear defaults are important. Here’s how the structure is described on our wiki:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Stripe lists follow one of these forms:</p>

<p>foo-announce@: Email from the foo project to the company at large. These lists are generally low-traffic, have self-contained postings, and are intended for people who aren’t keeping up with the project in real time. For example, recruiting-announce@ is where we post notifications of job offers and outcomes thereof.</p>

<p>foo@: Email that would be on a traditional discussion list goes here. In other words, pretend that foo-archive@ did not exist. In that universe, would you send you mail on-list or off-list? If on-list, send to foo@.</p>

<p id="archive-list">foo-archive@: Email that you want to grant other people read access to, but don’t have any real expectation of them reading. Use this for email that would traditionally be off-list, whether due to volume or being targeted to a particular recipient or just being generally uninteresting.</p>

<p>foo-bots@: Automated mail for the foo project goes here. Depending on the project, it may be important for you to read this email. (For example, all breakages go to breakage-bots@, and so people who are triaging breakages should watch that list.)</p>

<p>In general, if you’re debating including an archive list, you should probably just include it. This includes internal P2P email which you would normally leave off a list, emails to vendors, and scheduling email. (If the email is sensitive in some way, though, it’s fine to leave it off-list.)</p>

<h2>What you should read</h2>

<ul>
	<li>You should definitely read any email sent directly to you.</li>
	<li>You should at least skim (or skim the subject lines of) all emails to the foo@ list for the project you’re currently working on (e.g. product@, ops@, etc.).</li>
	<li>You should feel no obligation to read any foo-archive@ lists. If you find yourself having to trawl through those lists in order to get things done, that means that foo-archive@ is getting traffic it shouldn’t.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also keep these conventions in mind when assessing what mail you expect other people to see. In particular:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You should expect mail sent to a person to be read by that person.</li>
	<li>You should expect mail sent to a project list to be read by most people working on that project.</li>
	<li>You should not expect mail anywhere else to be read by a human.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Email Use Cases</h2>

<p>We support the following use-cases. Details about which list to send to in each case is shown below. If you ever find yourself thinking hard about which list to CC, just pick one—it’s not a big deal to have email go to the wrong list.</p>

<ul>
	<li>human → external human (e.g. Darragh → banking partner):
		<ul>

  <li>CC a project list (project@): when you want the outside human to know they’re on-list, and respond including the list.</li>
  <li>BCC a project list (project@): when this is something you’d like others on your project to be aware of.</li>
  <li>BCC a project archive list (project-archive@): when this is something no one else needs to care about at the moment (e.g. scheduling a meeting time with someone).</li>
  <li>Leave off list: if there’s personal content that you’re not comfortable with others seeing (this case should be pretty rare, and tends mostly to come up when recruiting friends).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>human → Stripe human (e.g. Andy → Sheena):
	<ul>

  <li>CC a project list (project@): when this is something that you’d like other Stripes to be aware of or feel invited to participate in.</li>
  <li>CC a project archive list (project-archive@): when no one else needs to be thinking about this problem and you’re having a direct conversation.</li>
  <li>Leave off list: when you have constructive criticism relevant only to that person. You should always feel free to point out problems and places for improvement (trying to maximize quality is pretty core to Stripe), but this is one case that’s generally better to handle in private. (Still, broader questions like “should we even be working on this product” are usually best handled on-list.)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>human → project (e.g. Greg → people working on systems):
	<ul>
	  <li>CC project list (project@): always.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>human → company (e.g. Amber announcing the attendance numbers from a hackathon):
	<ul>
	  <li>CC a project announce list (project-announce@): if there is a relevant announce list.</li>
	  <li>CC all@: otherwise (you should feel welcome to post stuff to all@—current traffic is about 10 messages a day).</li>
	</ul>

<li>robot → project (e.g. <a href="http://pagerduty.com">PagerDuty</a> to developers):
	<ul>
	  <li>CC a project-bots list (project-bots@): always (note that bots lists all have a Reply-To set to the corresponding project list).</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>robot → company (e.g. hourly stats report):
  <ul><li>CC all-bots@: always</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>One important property of this setup is that it’s opt-in: no email is automatically made public, and what lists to copy (or not) is a decision that’s taken on a per-email basis.</p>

<p>As with much of what we do, we’re not sure yet how this will scale. Still, most of the experience of a startup is doing things that work well at some size, and then figuring out how to make them continue to work as you grow. The email transparency is something that people consistently identify as one of the best parts of Stripe’s structure, and we plan to work hard to retain its core properties as we grow. If you end up implementing any of these practices in your workplace, I’d be <a href="mailto:gdb@stripe.com">very curious to hear how it goes</a>.</p>

<p>A rising tide lifts all boats, and we’d like to help improve payment experiences for consumers everywhere, whether or not they use Stripe. Today, we’re releasing <a href="https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment">jQuery.payment</a>, a general purpose library for building credit card forms, validating input, and formatting numbers. This library is behind a lot of the functionality in <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fblog%252Fstripe-checkout">Checkout</a>.</p>

<p>Some sites require a bit more flexibility than our Checkout provides. This is where jQuery.payment shines. You can have some of the same formatting and validation as in the Checkout along with as much flexibility as you need.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>For example, you can ensure that a text input is formatted as a credit card number, with digits in groups of four and limited to 16 characters.</p>

<div class="example">
  <pre>$('input.cc-num').payment('formatCardNumber');</pre>
  <input type="text" class="cc-num" placeholder="1234 5678 9123 4567" pattern="\d*">
</div>

<p>Or you can ensure input is formatted as a MM/YYYY card expiry:</p>

<div class="example">
  <pre>$('input.cc-exp').payment('formatCardExpiry');</pre>
  <input type="text" class="cc-exp" placeholder="MM / YY" pattern="\d*">
</div>

<p>The library includes a bunch of utility and validation methods, for example:</p>

<pre>
$.payment.validateCardNumber('4242 4242 4242 4242'); //=> true
$.payment.validateCardCVC('123', 'amex'); //=> false
$.payment.validateCardExpiry('05', '20'); //=> true

$.payment.cardType('4242 4242 4242 4242'); //=> 'visa'
</pre>

<h2>Robust and tested</h2>

<p>It turns out that rolling your own code that restricts and formats input is particularly tricky in JavaScript. You have to cater for lots of edge cases such as users pasting text, selecting and replacing numbers, as well as the different ways credit card numbers are formatted.
</p>

<p>We’ve spent a lot of time tuning our formatting and validation logic as well as testing and ensuring cross browser compatibility, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. We look forward to seeing what you build! You can find a <a href="http://stripe.github.com/jquery.payment/example/">live demo of the library</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment">source on GitHub</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Today, we are
    releasing <a href="https://github.com/stripe/mosql">MoSQL</a>, a
    tool Stripe developed for live-replicating data from a MongoDB
    database into a PostgreSQL database. With MoSQL, you can run
    applications against a MongoDB database, but also maintain a
    live-updated mirror of your data in PostgreSQL, ready for querying
    with the full power of SQL.
  </p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>
    Here at Stripe, we use a number of different database technologies
    for both internal- and external-facing services. Over time, we've
    found ourselves with growing amounts of data in
    <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> that we would like
    to be able to analyze using SQL. MongoDB is great for a lot of
    reasons, but it's hard to beat SQL for easy ad-hoc data
    aggregation and analysis, especially since virtually every
    developer or analyst already knows it.
  </p>

  <p> An obvious solution is to periodically dump your MongoDB
    database and re-import into PostgreSQL, perhaps
    using <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongoexport/">mongoexport</a>. We
    experimented with this approach, but found ourselves frustrated
    with the ever-growing time it took to do a full refresh. Even if
    most of your analyses can tolerate a day or two of delay,
    occasionally you want to ask ad-hoc questions about "what happened
    last night?", and it's frustrating to have to wait on a huge
    dump/load refresh to do that. In response, we built MoSQL,
    enabling us to keep a real-time SQL mirror of our Mongo data.
  </p>

  <p>
    MoSQL does an initial import of your MongoDB collections into a
    PostgreSQL database, and then continues running, applying any
    changes to the MongoDB server in near-real-time to the PostgreSQL
    mirror. The replication works by tailing the
    MongoDB <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replication+Internals">oplog</a>,
    in essentially the same way Mongo's
    own <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/replication/">replication</a>
    works.
  </p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p> MoSQL can be installed like any other gem: </p>

  <p><pre>$ <b>gem install mosql</b></pre></p>

  <p>To use MoSQL, you'll need to create
  a <a href="https://github.com/stripe/mosql#the-collection-map-file"><b>collection
  map</b></a> which maps your MongoDB objects to a SQL schema. We'll
  use the collection from
  the <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started/">MongoDB
  tutorial</a> as an example. A possible collection map for that
  collection would look like:
  </p>

<pre>
mydb:
  things:
    :columns:
      - _id: TEXT
      - x: INTEGER
      - j: INTEGER
    :meta:
     :table: things
     :extra_props: true
</pre>

  <p>Save that file as <b>collections.yaml</b>, start a local mongod
  and postgres, and run:</p>

  <p><pre>$ <b>mosql --collections collections.yaml</b></pre></p>

  <p>Now, run through
  the <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started/">MongoDB
  tutorial</a>, and then open a <b>psql</b> shell. You'll find all
  your Mongo data now available in SQL form:

<pre>
postgres=# select * from things limit 5;
           _id            | x | j |   _extra_props   
--------------------------+---+---+------------------
 50f445b65c46a32ca8c84a5d |   |   | {"name":"mongo"}
 50f445df5c46a32ca8c84a5e | 3 |   | {}
 50f445e75c46a32ca8c84a5f | 4 | 1 | {}
 50f445e75c46a32ca8c84a60 | 4 | 2 | {}
 50f445e75c46a32ca8c84a61 | 4 | 3 | {}
(5 rows)
</pre>

  <p>
    <b>mosql</b> will continue running, syncing any further changes
    you make into Postgres.
  </p>

  <p>For more documentation and usage information, see
  the <a href="https://github.com/stripe/mosql">README.</a>
  </p>

  <h2><b>mongoriver</b></h2>

  <p> MoSQL comes from a general philosophy of preferring real-time,
    continuously-updating solutions to periodic batch jobs.
  <p>

  <p> MoSQL is built on top
    of <a href="https://github.com/stripe/mongoriver">mongoriver</a>,
    a general library for MongoDB oplog tailing that we
    developed. Along with the MoSQL release, we have also released
    mongoriver as open source today. If you find yourself wanting to
    write your own MongoDB tailer, to monitor updates to your data in
    near-realtime, check it out.

<div class="image-right checkout"><img src="../../img/blog/posts/checkout/checkout.png" data-hires="true" width="304" height="386" /></div>

<p>From talking to our users, it’s clear to us that building great payments forms is hard, and that small details can have a big impact on the user experience. Even minor tweaks regularly drive substantial swings in conversion rates. Creating a great payment flow is a design problem faced by almost everyone running an online business.</p>

<p>And so we started trying to figure out how we can help. We see millions of transactions, and have access to a lot of data about what works well and what doesn’t. We wondered whether we could create something that looks great, makes Stripe easier to integrate, improves with time, and results in a better payment experience for users.</p>

<p>We’ve been experimenting over the past few months, and we’re ready to release our first version&nbsp;today.</p>

<h2>Even simpler integration</h2>

<p>
It’s unfortunate that everyone has to reinvent the wheel when the time comes to implement a payments UI. We decided to build something that you can just drop in as a single tag:</p>

   <pre><span class="highlight_js xml">&lt;script src=&quot;https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js&quot;
    class=&quot;stripe-button&quot;
    data-key=&quot;pk_Fhlzwtm9SCx6Uxww5fNXX8CUbwwAc&quot;
    data-amount=&quot;2000&quot;
    data-name=&quot;Demo Site&quot;
    data-description=&quot;2 widgets ($20.00)&quot;
    data-image=&quot;/128x128.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</span></pre>

<div class="demo result">
  <script
    src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"
    data-key="pk_Fhlzwtm9SCx6Uxww5fNXX8CUbwwAc"
    data-amount="2000"
    data-name="Demo Site"
    data-description="2 widgets ($20.00)"
    data-image="/img/documentation/checkout/marketplace.png"
    data-notrack>
  </script>
</div>

<p>
Rather than show the payment form directly on the page, we decided to have it appear as an overlay. This, combined with the dimmed background, helps to provide a little separation from the enclosing page while still making it clear to users that they haven’t left the site. We’ve worked hard to make sure that it fits well with almost any design. <span class="result">Try out the demo above with our test card number <code>4242 4242 4242 4242</code>.</span>
</p>

<p>
Though you’re welcome to use the button we show here, you can trigger the Checkout’s overlay with any HTML element or JavaScript event—the blue button is just a default. There’s a full JavaScript API and a bunch of configuration options. We do all the validation, input formatting, and error handling for you, as well as taking care of securely transferring your customer’s payment information to Stripe.
</p>

<h2>Built-in mobile support</h2>

<p>
Despite the explosion of smartphones and tablets, a web site’s mobile payment flows are often neglected. Developers are confronted with a plethora of devices, screen sizes, and browser-specific challenges. We wanted the form to automatically adapt to mobile devices, and it includes a dedicated mobile flow, optimized for iOS and Android.
</p>

<div class="image-left mobile"><img src="../../img/blog/posts/checkout/phones.png" data-hires="true" width="226" height="311" /></div>

<p>
Of course, it’s not just about supporting recent devices. This also works on all major browsers, including IE 7 and above.
</p>

<h2>Optimized, tested, and always improving</h2>

<p>
Over the last few months, we’ve been field-testing on a variety of sites, collecting data and incorporating feedback. The early results are promising—for example, App.net increased their conversion rate by 10%—but we don’t yet have enough data to make any conclusive claims.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we think the structural shift is most important. Normally, you build a payment form and move on. Maybe you eventually get time to revisit it a year later. By integrating Stripe’s payment form, your checkout is continually improving. As we refine and iterate over time, we’ll be able to immediately pass enhancements on to anyone who uses it. We’re looking forward to seeing what you build, and to doing our part to help improve commerce on the web.

  <div class="content">
    
<p>In an effort to make sure you get paid with as few hitches as possible, we've made some improvements to how we expose information about transfers to you.  Happy new year!</p>

<div class="feature-list">

	<h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong>Viewing and retrying transfers in your dashboard</h3>
	<p>
	 When you click on the transfers link on your sidebar, you will now be taken to a <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/transfers/overview">transfers overview</a> section that shows you how much we've been paying you out.
  </p>

  <p>
   In the unfortunate case that a transfer to your bank account fails, you'll now see a small alert dot on your sidebar next to the transfers section.  When you click it, you'll see a list of all the transfers that failed at the top, <a href="../../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Fdocs%252Ftransfers">detailed instructions</a> on how to resolve the issue, and a way to retry all your transfers. You can now also <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/transfers?status=retried">filter your transfers</a> to find all your transfers that you have already retried or just the transfers that have failed but have not yet been retried.
	</p>

	<h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong>Changes to transfer-related notifications</h3>
  <p>
    We've added a lot of information to the transfer return notifications we send you to tell you exactly what to do based on the failure message we got from your bank.  We will also make sure that you don't end up with failed transfers that go unnoticed -- we will send you a notification every week that you have any failed transfers hanging around in your account.
  </p>

  <h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong>More information about the state of your transfers</h3>
  <p>
   In certain situations, transfers to your account can get delayed.  We now expose any potential delays to your transfers to you on the individual transfer pages.

    <p>We’ve always believed in simple, low prices. In this vein, we’re making two changes today:</p>

<div class="feature-list">

	<h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong> No fees on refunded charges</h3>
	<p>
	 When you refund a transaction, Stripe will return the entire fee. Until today, if you charged $100 and then refunded the transaction, it would still cost you $3.20&mdash;that is, 2.9% + $0.30. From now on, it will be free.
	</p>

	<h3><strong class="new"><span>New</span></strong> No fees for successfully-challenged disputes</h3>
  <p>If one of your customers disputes a payment, Stripe charges a fee of $15. However, you have the option of challenging the dispute. If that’s successful, and the cardholder’s bank decides in your favor, we’ll now refund that $15.</p>

</div>
<p>Both of these changes go into effect immediately.</p>
