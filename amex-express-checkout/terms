  <article>
    <h1 id="about-american-express-checkout">About American Express Checkout</h1>

    <p>Thank you for using <a href="../country?country=CH&amp;redirect=%252Famex-express-checkout">Amex Express Checkout</a> with Stripe.  The Stripe integration of Amex Express Checkout allows U.S. American Express® Card Members to check out quickly at participating online merchants by using their americanexpress.com account login.  With Amex Express Checkout, Card Members simply use their existing americanexpress.com User ID and Password, and American Express auto-fills the checkout fields with their American Express Card details and relevant account information in just a few clicks. Amex Express Checkout is not a wallet, and does not require a Card Member to create or manage a new account.</p>

    <h1 id="amex-express-checkout-addendum-to-the-stripe-terms-of-service">Amex Express Checkout Addendum to the Stripe Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>This Amex Express Checkout Addendum (as amended from time to time, the “Addendum”) is made between the sole proprietor or business organization listed as the “Merchant” on the Service registration page (sometimes referred to as “you,” “your”, “user”) and Stripe, Inc.  (“Stripe” or “we”, “our” or “us”).  This Addendum governs your use of Amex Express Checkout (“Amex Service”), as offered by American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (“Amex”).  The Amex Service is offered in conjunction with the Service (as defined in the Stripe Terms of Service) and this Addendum provides additional terms and conditions to those included in the <a href="../terms">Stripe Terms of Service</a>.  </p>

    <h2 id="amex-service">1.  Amex Service</h2>

    <p>Your use of the Amex Service, including your treatment of information accessed through the Amex Service, is subject to your consent and agreement to comply with the terms of this Addendum, any documentation we make available to you from time to time (the “Documentation”), and the Stripe Terms of Service.  Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meanings provided in the Stripe Terms of Service.  </p>

    <p>We may discontinue offering the Amex Service at any time upon notice to you.  You may discontinue the use of the Amex Service at any time by way of removing the application that is using the Amex Service and providing notice to Stripe at https://support.stripe.com/email/.  </p>

    <h2 id="ownership-and-use-of-card-member-data">2.  Ownership and Use of Card Member Data</h2>

At any point, Amex may review the form and content of your requests to customers for such express consent and disclosure statements or notices in connection with the foregoing to ensure that such requests, disclosure statements, and notices are sufficient.  To the extent that Amex believes such consents, disclosure statements, or notices are not sufficient, you may be required to alter them in order to continue to use the Amex Service.  At no point may any consent or other agreement with a customer grant any use or other rights to Amex Checkout Data that are not provided in this Addendum.  Further, you may not condition the processing of a transaction for a customer using the Amex Service on their providing any such consent.   </p>

    <h2 id="governing-law-arbitration">8.  Governing Law, Arbitration</h2>

    <p>This Addendum is subject to the governing law provisions of the Stripe Terms of Service.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Amex, as a third-party beneficiary under this Addendum, brings a claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Addendum (“Disputes”) against you or you bring a Dispute against Amex , such Dispute will be subject to the laws of the State of New York, without consideration of conflicts of law principles and will be subject to the following arbitration process:</p>

    <h3 id="a-procedures">(a) Procedures.</h3>

    <p>Any and all Disputes will be submitted for binding arbitration.  Unless you and Amex agree otherwise, arbitration will take place in the State of New York, New York County, and will be administered by, and pursuant to the rules of, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).</p>

    <h3 id="b-process">(b) Process.</h3>

    <p>Disputes will be arbitrated on an individual basis.  There will be no right or authority for any Disputes to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or other persons or entities similarly situated.  The arbitrator’s authority to resolve Disputes and to make awards is limited to disputes between you and Amex alone.  Furthermore, Disputes brought by either you or Amex against the other may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with disputes brought by or against any third party, unless agreed to in writing by both parties.

    <h2 id="implementation-guidelines">9.  Implementation Guidelines</h2>

    <p>You will adhere to the following implementation guidelines and requirements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All allowable graphics for the Amex Express Checkout Button are available in the Documentation, which you must use as presented and may not resize, recolor, or modify.</li>
      <li>Where using radio button implementations, the primary implementation is to leverage the payment mark in tandem with copy “Amex Express Checkout”; the secondary implementation is to leverage the button in tandem with copy “Amex Express Checkout”; and the tertiary implementation is to leverage the copy “Amex Express Checkout” on its own.  You may not alter the spelling, capitalization, or styles for “Amex Express Checkout”.  For instance, and without limitation, “AMEX Express Checkout”, “American Express Checkout”, and “Amex Checkout” are all incorrect uses.</li>
      <li>You will not use any other Amex trademarks or graphics (i.e., payment acceptance mark or Amex blue box logo) instead of the approved Amex Express Checkout Button.  Payment acceptance marks on your site (as differentiated from the Amex Express Checkout Button) should always be the Amex blue box logo.</li>
      <li>The Amex Express Checkout Button must always be clickable where implemented.  You may not use the Amex Express Checkout Button in place of a payment acceptance mark or Amex blue box logo on your payment site.</li>
      <li>Amex suggests placing the Amex Express Checkout Button prior to the majority of manual entry fields, to take full advantage of the autofill capability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="term-and-termination">10.  Term and Termination</h2>

    <p>Once accepted, this Addendum will remain in effect until terminated by you or Stripe.  Where we terminate your use of the Services, this Addendum will concurrently terminate.  You may terminate this Addendum at any time by removing the application that is using the Amex Service and providing notice to Stripe at https://support.stripe.com/email/.  In addition, Amex may suspend or terminate your ability to use the Amex Service at any time.  Upon termination, you will immediately remove the AEC Button from your application.  Your continued use of the Amex Service will constitute your continued acceptance of the terms of this Addendum, the Documentation, and the Stripe Terms of Service.  </p>

    <h2 id="general-terms">11.  General Terms.</h2>

    <p>In case of conflict between the terms of this Addendum and the Stripe Terms of Service, this Addendum shall prevail with respect to the Amex Service. All other terms of the Stripe Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.</p>
